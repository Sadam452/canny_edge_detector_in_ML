Detection of image edges using canny edge detection technique
This repo contains a simple program which uses cv2 library to detect edges of an image. You just need to mention the path of image in this program. You can also adjust the visibility and grey scale level by varying the values of (1oo,1oo) in cv2.Canny(image,100,100).
